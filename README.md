# Southern Cross Equestrian Centre



# Goal for this Project
The goal of this project is to design and build a website to advertise an Equestrian Centre and inspire people 
to become customers.

It should provide information about the centre, what it offers, where it is and how to get there.
It should provide various means of contacing the organisers, phone numbers, email and submitting a question or query 
via a form.

## Design Choices

### Fonts
?

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
?


I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/new-colour-pallet.JPG)


 
 ?

### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the centre, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:


### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/scec_desktop.png "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/scec_tablet.png "Tablet wireframe")
### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/scec_phone.png "Phone wireframe")

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the centre logo which doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Desktop (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;
    ![Navigation bar](wireframes/nav-bar-desktop.JPG)
    -   Spanning the full width of the device and with all links (Home, About, Events, Contact) to navigate visible, this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

    -   In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

    ![Navigation bar on hover](wireframes/nav-bar-hover.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;
    -   For the user to know that a link has been clicked there is also a visual aid of the text changing colour.

    ![Navigation bar on focus](wireframes/nav-bar-focus.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;


+ Small devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
    - As the navigation bar would be unuseable in the desktop version on smaller devices, it takes on a hamburger style.

    \
    &nbsp;
![Nav bar on small devices](wireframes/nav-bar-small.JPG)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available then.

### Landing Page

+ The landing page image
    - The image gives the user instant knowledge of what is involved in the centre, and with added animation draws their eye to the site.
    - The text gives instant information to the user on what the centre is. With the added animation of fading in slightly behind the image, it makes the user keep interest. 
    \

### Footer

+ The footer contains the social media links related to the equestrian centre and the copyright text. These social links all open in a new tab for ease of use to the user and also, so the user has an ability to easily come back to the equestrian centre's site.
    \
    &nbsp;

    ![Contact Section](wireframes/footer.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;

+ There is also a hover effect over the links, again to improve user experiance.
